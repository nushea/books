                                <p> 1. The usage of the term frame is used since the HaRe believe that Time passes through the smallest unit of itself, similar to a Plank's time, the term frame itself is used as a simple equivalent. </p>
                                <p> 2. In this context the word  may mean a series of words like to behold, to change, to choose, to participate, to parttake </p>
                                <p> 3. The term  is used to mean both planet and moon and in general any "wanderer" besides the sun </p>
                                <p> 4. The term  represents a mythical creature that is akin to a giant elephant, but in practice the word is used to refer to any elephant </p>
